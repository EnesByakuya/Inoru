Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step roadmap to guide you through building your very first Kotlin-based prayer times app. This roadmap is designed for beginners and covers everything from learning the fundamentals to deploying and iterating on your project. Each phase includes recommended tasks, concepts to learn, and next steps for expanding your skillset.

## Phase 1: Laying the Foundations

### 1. Learn Kotlin Basics
- **Resources:**
    - [Kotlin Official Documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html)
    - Free online courses (e.g., Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers on Udacity)
- **Key Topics:**
    - Variables, data types, and control flow
    - Functions and lambda expressions
    - Classes, objects, and basic OOP concepts
    - Collections (lists, maps) and basic data structures

### 2. Understand Android Fundamentals
- **Resources:**
    - [Android Developers Guide](https://developer.android.com/guide)
    - Tutorials on building your first Android app
- **Key Topics:**
    - Android Studio setup and project structure
    - Understanding Activities, Views, and Layouts
    - Basic XML for UI design
    - How Android manages app lifecycles

---

## Phase 2: Project Setup and Version Control

### 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment
- **Install Android Studio:**  
  Download and install Android Studio, which includes all necessary SDKs and tools.
- **Create a New Project:**
    - Choose an **Empty Activity** template.
    - Configure your project name (e.g., `PrayerTimesApp`), package, and minimum SDK.
    - Confirm Kotlin is selected as your primary language.

### 2. Initialize Git for Version Control
- **Local Repository Setup:**
    - In Android Studio, open the Terminal and run `git init` to create a Git repository.
- **Create a .gitignore File:**
    - Add a standard Android/.gitignore to exclude build files, local configuration, and IDE-specific files.
- **Link to GitHub:**
    - Create a new repository on GitHub (with a .gitignore and license pre-added if desired).
    - Run commands:
      ```bash
      git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/PrayerTimesApp.git
      git branch -M main
      git push -u origin main
      ```

## Phase 3: Building the Core App (Hardcoded Prayer Times)

### 1. Designing the User Interface
- **Layout File:**
    - Open `activity_main.xml` and design a simple UI using a vertical `LinearLayout`.
    - Add a heading (`TextView`) and a series of `TextView` elements for each prayer time.
- **Focus on UI/UX:**
    - Learn basic XML layout principles (padding, margins, text styling).
    - Experiment with themes and colors to keep the design appealing.

### 2. Writing Kotlin Code to Bind the UI
- **MainActivity Setup:**
    - Open `MainActivity.kt` and use `findViewById` to bind UI elements.
    - Create a simple data structure (e.g., a `Map`) to hold your hardcoded prayer times.
    - Set the text of each `TextView` dynamically using Kotlin string interpolation.
- **Concepts to Practice:**
    - Basic Kotlin syntax and Android lifecycle (onCreate method)
    - Referencing resources (IDs and strings)

### 3. Running and Debugging Your App
- **Emulator or Device Testing:**
    - Set up an emulator via the AVD Manager or use a physical device.
    - Run your app and check that the prayer times display correctly.
- **Debugging:**
    - Learn to use Logcat and breakpoints in Android Studio to troubleshoot issues.

## Phase 4: Adding More Features Gradually

### 1. Implementing an Alarm for Prayer Times
- **AlarmManager vs. WorkManager:**
    - Research Android’s AlarmManager for scheduling alarms or WorkManager for background tasks.
- **Tasks:**
    - Set up a basic alarm that triggers a notification at a specified time.
    - Understand pending intents and how to manage background tasks responsibly.

### 2. Integrating Location-Based Prayer Times
- **Permissions and APIs:**
    - Learn about Android’s Location APIs and the permissions model (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION).
- **Tasks:**
    - Retrieve the device’s last known location.
    - Provide an option for the user to manually select a location (using maps or a simple input).
- **Concepts to Master:**
    - Runtime permissions and handling user responses.
    - Working with location data (latitude, longitude).

### 3. Adding Additional Features (Optional Enhancements)
- **Qibla Finder:**
    - Use the device’s compass sensor along with GPS to calculate Qibla direction.
- **Hijri Calendar Integration:**
    - Explore libraries or algorithms that convert Gregorian dates to Hijri.
- **Customizable Calculation Methods:**
    - Create settings to allow users to choose between different prayer time calculation methods.
- **Widgets & Notifications:**
    - Build a home screen widget to show upcoming prayer times.
    - Set up notifications to alert users when it’s time to pray.
- **Offline Support & Caching:**
    - Integrate Room or SharedPreferences to cache prayer times and settings for offline use.

## Phase 5: Enhancing Code Quality and Application Robustness

### 1. Learn and Apply Modern Architecture Patterns
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**
    - Separate your business logic (ViewModel) from UI (View) for better maintainability.
- **Clean Architecture:**
    - Consider separating your code into layers (presentation, domain, data) for scalability.
- **Android Jetpack:**
    - Explore components like LiveData, ViewModel, and Navigation Component.

### 2. Writing Tests and Ensuring Quality
- **Unit Testing:**
    - Learn JUnit basics and write tests for your calculation functions or business logic.
- **UI Testing:**
    - Explore Espresso for UI tests to automate user interactions.
- **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    - Optionally set up a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions or similar) to run tests automatically on new commits.

## Phase 6: Deployment and Future Enhancements

### 1. Preparing for Deployment
- **Optimize Your App:**
    - Profile your app for performance and battery usage (important if using background services).
    - Fine-tune UI for different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Generate a Signed APK/App Bundle:**
    - Follow Android Studio’s guidelines to build a signed release version of your app.

### 2. Publishing to the Play Store (Long-Term Goal)
- **Developer Account:**
    - Create a Google Play Developer account.
- **App Listing:**
    - Prepare assets (screenshots, description, icons) and follow the Play Store guidelines.
- **Iterative Updates:**
    - Use user feedback and analytics to plan future updates and features.

### 3. Continuous Learning and Community Engagement
- **Documentation:**
    - Maintain clear code documentation and a README in your repository.
- **Seek Mentorship and Peer Review:**
    - Join developer communities (Stack Overflow, Reddit’s r/androiddev) to get feedback.
- **Iterative Improvement:**
    - Keep refactoring your code, adding features, and improving app performance as you learn more.
